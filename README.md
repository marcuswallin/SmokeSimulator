# SmokeSimulator

This is a computer graphics project for the course TSBK07 at Link√∂ping University.

Smoke is created by generation of billboards with smoke texture on, and also each billboard has a bump map which makes the smoke have more of a 3D-feeling.

Images and a video of how it looks will come soon.
